# S3 backend has multiple states

Dear team,
accordingly https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt-infrastructure-live-example/blob/master/terragrunt.hcl#L43
Due to each module located in separated dir, would each module have its own .tfstate (one per module)? Is it correct?

Yes that is correct. This is intentional, and one of the strengths of terragrunt (making it easy to manage modules with different state files).

Sounds good, thanks for the clear answer.
