# MacOS Monterey - bad CPU type in executable: terragrunt

**snehal1219901** commented *May 25, 2022*

**Describe the bug**
Downloaded the latest terragrunt binary , renamed to terragrunt, added execute permissions and placed the binary at my PATH.
However, terragrunt does not run.
Error: zsh: bad CPU type in executable: terragrunt


**Expected behavior**
Terragrunt should be installed and terragrunt commands should run.

Are you using an M1 (ARM architecture) Mac? If you are, you should use the [terragrunt_darwin_arm64](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/releases/download/v0.38.1/terragrunt_darwin_arm64) binary.
