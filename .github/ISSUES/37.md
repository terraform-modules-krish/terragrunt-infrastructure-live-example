# Need to update readme and bucket pre-requisites 

**darpham** commented *Jun 6, 2020*

Hello TerraGrunts,

Looks like README.md needs to be updated to reflect latest commit with merging and moving `terragrung.tcl` to the root directory.
[README.md](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt-infrastructure-live-example/blob/master/README.md)
Lines 31 -34

> Update the `bucket` parameter in `non-prod/terragrunt.hcl` and `prod/terragrunt.hcl` to unique names. We use S3 [as a Terraform backend](https://www.terraform.io/docs/backends/types/s3.html) to store your Terraform state, and S3 bucket names must be globally unique. The names currently in the file are already taken, so you'll have to specify your own. Alternatives, you can set the environment variable `TG_BUCKET_PREFIX` to set a custom prefix.

Thank you!
