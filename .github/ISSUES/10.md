So I changed the region to us-west-1 in terraform.tfvars and account.tfvars and now I get a new error: 

> * aws_elb.webserver_example: InvalidConfigurationRequest: Default subnet in us-west-1a not found
>         status code: 409, request id: 6798ae77-d2d0-11e8-a782-2350935b2baa

So I tried to create a Default subnet in us-west-1a and AWS console gives me the error: 

> Create Subnet Error
> Value (us-west-1a) for parameter availabilityZone is invalid. Subnets can currently only be created in the following availability zones: us-west-1b, us-west-1c.

Looks like AWS has added a new availability zone that, for some reason, doesn't support the Classic Load Balancer (CLB). The examples in this repo use the CLB and all your availability zones by default: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt-infrastructure-modules-example/blob/master/asg-elb-service/main.tf#L121. You'd have to tweak this to only the availability zones that support the CLB: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt-infrastructure-modules-example/blob/master/asg-elb-service/main.tf#L41

Not sure about the subnet errors you're having!

Thanks.

I have hard-coded some fixes which run, in v0.0.1 of my fork https://github.com/mlintonford/terragrunt-infrastructure-live-example/releases.  If I find time I'll make my code more elegant and submit a PR, but meanwhile anyone encountering this problem can look at my fixes to get these examples to run.
