# Needs update on terraform GH sources for modules

**darpham** commented *Jun 6, 2020*

This live example is currently broken without the latest commits being included in the latest modules from the [modules-example](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt-infrastructure-modules-example) repository.

You can see more details on the issue I [created over there](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt-infrastructure-modules-example/issues/15).

Once the changes in the issue above has been addressed, we will need to update the `Terraform Sources` for the modules.

Thanks!
