# .yml files no loger supported ?

**ep4sh** commented *Mar 11, 2020*

Accordingly [commit](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt-infrastructure-live-example/commit/63ec403427aabd8ce5b2c86c1955921ec886282c) I see you have deleted all .yml files, could you please explain is it best practice to use them for variables?

`.yml` is still supported and can be used, but with the introduction of `read_terragrunt_config`, you can also use `.hcl` for that purpose. The benefit of using `hcl` over `yaml` is that yaml is a static data language, so you don't have any support for computations and processing over the data. With `hcl`, you have access to all the functions terragrunt supports, and the ability to compose locals to construct more complex expressions. We feel that this is going to be a more extensible practice than using yaml, and thus we switched our examples over. That said, it really comes down to personal preference: both are valid formats for this purpose and you should use whichever feels better.

Thanks for this answer, could you please also tell, `read_terragrunt_config` and `import` are similar functions?
I try to create `GLOBAL` vars in `terragrunt.hcl` and retrieve them in module's `terragrunt.hcl`
How can I realize it?

The feature you are looking for is the `import` block which just completed the design cycle, but is not implemented yet. See the RFC for more details: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/master/_docs/rfc/imports.md

So at the moment, I cant do it simply with `read_terragrunt_config`, I mean I can read child config, but nor the parent, right?

**yorinasub17** commented *Mar 13, 2020*

You can read the parent as well, but you can't have cycles. That is, you can't have the child read the parent to expose child vars to the parent, while _simultaneously_ having the child read the parent to get the parent vars.

Can I define the parent list/map/list of maps value (on the root level) and then refine it (on env level)?
For e.g. in `terrafrunt.hcl`:
```
locals {

vpc_list = {
  vpc_a = "vpc_bla1",
  vpc_b = "vpc_bla2",
}

}
```
In the `env.hcl`:
```
locals {
vpc_name = "vpc_a"
vpc_id = local.vpc_list[vpc_name]
}
```
I  tried to do that but getting error that "value cannot be evalueted"..

Unfortunately, that is not supported. `locals` are local to the configuration that defined it (that's why they are called "local", as opposed to "global") and are not automatically merged across `include`s, due to the complexity of implementing a cross configuration references of `locals`.
