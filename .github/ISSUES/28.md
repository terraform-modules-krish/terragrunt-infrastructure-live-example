# Path duplication on lookup

**Vad1mo** commented *Mar 5, 2020*

I am trying to run this example code here:

in `/Users/vadim/Development/temp/terragrunt-infrastructure-live-example/non-prod/us-east-1`

I execute `terragrunt plan-all` and get the error that the files can't be found. I seems, because the lookup is in the wrong path. 

```sh
prod/us-east-1/stage/webserver-cluster/Users/vadim/Development/temp/terragrunt-infrastructure-live-example/non-prod/us-east-1/region.yaml., and 1 other diagnostic(s)
[terragrunt] 2020/03/05 15:21:37 Encountered the following errors:

Ah yes this was from the recent backwards incompatible change. It should work if you downgrade to `0.22.5`.

Or alternatively, you can try out https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt-infrastructure-live-example/pull/29. Note that you will need to update the `aws_account_id` for it to work.

#29 is now merged so this issue is resolved.
