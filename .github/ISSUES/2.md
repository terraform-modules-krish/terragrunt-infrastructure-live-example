# Static lock table

I noticed that lock_table is hard coded. Why not have it based on the environment (prd, dev, qa) so that you can work on these in a parallel fashion?

The `lock_table` property (which by the way I now realize is [deprecated](https://www.terraform.io/docs/backends/types/s3.html) in favor of the `dynamodb_table` property!) specifies a DynamoDB *table*, but that table will have one row or entry for each unique Terraform state. Therefore, as long as you keep the Terraform states in your various environments separate, then you'll have a unique lock on each and can work in parallel as you desire.

I suspect that even if you use the same DynamoDB table for locks, if the `key` parameter is different, then the lock will be different too. Since you have different state files for each environment, and therefore different `key` values, you shouldn't be seeing lock contention.

Are you seeing something different?
