# Terragrunt Validate-All fails

**bbros-dev** commented *Oct 12, 2020*

Thank you for all the effort put into this tool and for making it open source.

We are new to terraform/terragrunt and find that `terragrunt validate-all` fails.

```
$ terragrunt --version
terragrunt version v0.25.1
```

Is this expected? 
If so is there a workaround?

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt-infrastructure-live-example.git

<elided>
$ cd terragrunt-infrastructure-live-example
$ terragrunt validate-all                                                      [15/234]

Ahhhh nevermind what was originally here: I just realized this is an issue with the example here.

Ah ok the issue here is that you are running `validate-all` from the root of the project. This is actually not a supported mode of operation for this example, given that the intention is for `prod` and `non-prod` to be two separate AWS accounts (meaning, you need to authenticate separately).

It should work if you use `validate-all` from the `prod` folder or `non-prod` folder.

Okay, so it seems a documentation issue.
