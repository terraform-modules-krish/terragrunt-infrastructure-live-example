# Deploy single module tries to destroy other modules

I am having strange behavior while migrating this example to google cloud provider I have following structure:
[infra.zip](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt-infrastructure-live-example/files/7327375/infra.zip)

no in modules there is folder cloud-run/save-image-fnc, when I run there terragrunt plan and apply to only deploy that module, Its trying to delete the storage-bucket module as well... hm any idea?

Ok, I found the root cause, while migrating from aws to gcs backend, I forgot to add to prefix:
${path_relative_to_include()}

in aws its a key attribute while in gcs backend its called prefix:


So the behavior is like you create one module, its ok, then you move to next directory and try to run plan and apply, but its using same state, so its trying to destory the previously created module.
