**Describe the bug**
I don't know how to use the `--terragrunt-source-map` param, it seems like it's completely ignored for me.

**To Reproduce**
We are using private repositories hosted in azure devops. The code to include another repo looks like this:

```hcl
module "core_api_specification" {
  source = "git::git@ssh.dev.azure.com:v3/<organization>/<project>/<repo>//<subpath>?ref=feature/random-feature"
  ... 
}
```
So far so good. I'm able to get the code with `terragrunt get` can plan and apply. But when I try to overwrite this source path with `--terragrunt-source-map git::git@ssh.dev.azure.com:v3/<organization>/<project>/<repo>=/abs/path/to/local/repo//<subpath>` it is completly ignored. I tried basically all premutations how you would be able to change the url, but the output from `--terragrunt-log-level debug` never contains anything from the second part (that should be used instead of the url).


**Expected behavior**
I expect it to actually use the local path. Could you help me understand what I'm doing wrong?

**info**
terragrunt version v0.38.4
Terraform v1.2.4 on darwin_arm64
