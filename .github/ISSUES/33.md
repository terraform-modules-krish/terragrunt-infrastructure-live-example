# Module dependencies example 

**Vad1mo** commented *Mar 23, 2020*

based on this example here a created two modules that have dependency to each other. DB to APP. 

RDS Module has dependencies to my App Module with `vpc_id` and `subnets`.

Based on dependencies section in the docs I created to following setup:
But when I run plan-all in `stage` I get asked to enter  `vpc_id` and `subnets.`which should not be the case. 


```yaml
myProject: 
  modules:
    app:
      - main.tf
      - terragrunt.hcl # empty file
    rds:
      - main.tf
      - terragrunt.hcl 
  prod:
  stage:
    eu-west-1:
      db:
        - terragrunt.hcl

```

The content of `myProject/modules/rds/terragrunt.hcl` is 

```hcl
dependency "vpc" {
  config_path = "../app"
}

inputs = {
  vpc_id     = dependency.vpc.outputs.vpc_id
  subnet_ids = dependency.vpc.outputs.private_subnets
}
```

This is the content of my `myProject/stage/eu-west-1/db/terragrunt.hcl`
```hcl
locals {
  environment_vars = read_terragrunt_config(find_in_parent_folders("env.hcl"))
  region_vars = read_terragrunt_config(find_in_parent_folders("region.hcl"))
  env        = local.environment_vars.locals.environment
  aws_region = local.region_vars.locals.aws_region
}

terraform {
  source = "${get_parent_terragrunt_dir()}/modules/rds/"
}
include {
  path = find_in_parent_folders()
}

inputs = {
  name = "sample-rds"
}
```

Maybe you could extend your example project and add module dependencies.

Hmm it looks like you have a `terragrunt.hcl` file in `modules/rds`, which you reference as the terraform source in another `terragrunt.hcl` file.

Terragrunt doesn't do any configuration processing of the module pointed to by the `terraform` block `source` attribute, as it assumes that is a terraform module. So it won't pick up the `terragrunt.hcl` file in your `modules/rds` folder, which is why it is not getting any dependencies. 

If you look at the examples, you will notice that the `infrastructure-modules` repo only contains terraform code, and all the terragrunt config lives here (and points only to the `infrastructure-modules` repo). Part of doing that is to make it extra clear that there should be no terragrunt configuration in the modules.

Given all that, to do what you want:

- Have the `dependency` block and `inputs` attributes in `myProject/stage/eu-west-1/db/terragrunt.hcl`
- If you want to make that reusable, you need to use `read_terragrunt_config` to import it in, or wait for `import` blocks

thx, somehow I got the impression it was also possible to do dependencies on modules.
