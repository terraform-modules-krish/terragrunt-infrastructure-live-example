# [sample] Need a sample on several conditions

**ozbillwang** commented *Jun 30, 2019*

could you please show me a sample, which can

1. reference module source version?

```
module "consul" {
  source  = "hashicorp/consul/aws"
  version = "0.0.5"
}
```

If I put in `terragrunt.hcl`
```
terraform {
  source  = "hashicorp/consul/aws"
  version = "0.0.5"
}
```
it prompted the error message, that doesn't know `version`

2. how to manage the tfstate file with terraform cloud?

The `version` param is not natively supported by Terragrunt right now. A PR to add that would be very welcome! In the meantime, the workaround is to use a Git URL with a `ref` parameter instead. E.g., 

```hcl
terraform {
  source = "github.com/hashicorp/terraform-aws-consul?ref=v0.0.5"
}
```

The Terraform Cloud backend should work like any of the others. In your Terraform code:

```hcl
terraform {
  # Partial configuration. Config will be filled in by Terragrunt.
  backend "remote" {}
}
```

In `terragrunt.hcl`:

```hcl
remote_state {
  backend = "remote"

  config = {
    organization = "Cloud-Org"

    workspaces {
      name = "Dev-QA"
    }
  }
}
```
