# [Question] How do I set different iam_role for prod and non-prod folders ?

How do I set different iam_role for prod and non-prod folders?

considering this PR from 2018 => https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/pull/599/files#diff-04c6e90faac2675aa89e2176d2eec7d8 it seems that I can configure a specific iam_role to be used by terragrunt (and terraform).

My goal is to have a CI/CD (Atlantis) to assume roles when executing the terragrunt command.

How can I set up one role for non-prod folder and a different one for the prod folder?

There are a number of options, including:

1. Have a different root `prod/terragrunt.hcl` and `non-prod/terragrunt.hcl`, each with different [`iam_role` setting](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/config-blocks-and-attributes/#iam_role), that all the child modules `include`. 
1. Have a single root `terragrunt.hcl` that uses [`generate`](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/reference/config-blocks-and-attributes/#generate) to generate a `provider` block with an [`assume_role`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#assume-role) block within. The `assume_role` block can set `role_arn` to a variable, which in prod envs you set to a different value than non-prod envs.

To add another option:

I am making use of direnv (https://direnv.net) for which I create .envrc files in the different account folders. This is what I include:
`export TERRAGRUNT_IAM_ROLE=arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNTID:role/ROLE` and other env variables as needed.

I am then able to go into the directory with the right role assumed and then being able to run Terragrunt.

Based on the input of @brikis98, I have created an example for option 2, see:

If it is interesting enough, I could create a pull request for it.
