# Why are there two "prod" folders in the directory tree?

Looking at the directory tree I am seeing two "prod" dirs on two different levels? What is the reason for this layout?

The top level `prod` represents an AWS account called "prod". It contains all the configurations for the prod AWS account in all regions. The nested `prod` represents a VPC called "prod" in the `us-east-1` region. It contains all the configuration for resources in the prod account, us-east-1 region, prod VPC.

The reasoning behind this layout is that you can have fine-grained control over what configurations are applied. For example, you could run `terragrunt run-all apply` (formerly `terragrunt apply-all`) at the `prod/us-east-1/prod` level to apply only the configurations in the prod vpc, us-east-1 region, prod account. Or, you could run the same command but at the `prod/us-east-1` level to apply all the configurations for the prod account, us-east-1 region. You can think of it as a hierarchy that allows you to have control over what configurations are applied at any given time.

@bwhaley, makes sense. Thanks for the explanation. I guess in my use case I just don't need such a layout because I use the Terragrunt live repository for a single product / project only and I know from the start that I only need a single region and VPC (per environment like prod, QA, and dev.

There are infinite ways to approach the layout so feel free to experiment! We're toying with another approach ourselves as outlined [here](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/1451#issuecomment-737155756).
