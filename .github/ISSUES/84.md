# Add structure for additional cloud providers. 

**CodyKurtz** commented *Feb 26, 2023*

Hi 

I like to see what the recommended folder structure would look like, if additional cloud providers were to be used. Some environment parameters could be consistent across clouds. 

I think some scenarios may be difficult to represent. For example, maybe I have an EKS cluster in prod on AWS and a GKE cluster in prod on GCP. But perhaps, I wish to use terraform to deploy the same Helm Chart or K8s resources to these clusters. How could I represent that best, where the helm values could be shared across clouds but also overridden for specific values. 

Thank you
