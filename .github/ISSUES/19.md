# [QUESTION] Multi region deployment

**davi5e** commented *Aug 26, 2019*

I'm using Terragrunt and it is amazing. This repo was very useful indeed when setting up my own.

That being said, I got confused by one particular design choice. Considering the tree below:
```
prod/
├── terragrunt.hcl
└── us-east-1/
    └── prod/
        ├── mysql/
        │   └── terragrunt.hcl
        └── webserver-cluster/
            └── terragrunt.hcl
```

And the fact the region is defined one folder level above `us-east-1`
```
inputs = {
  aws_region = "us-east-1"
}
```

I started wondering what would happen if two regions were to be used and how to go about duplicating the structure while maintaining the DRY aspect of Terragrunt.

The first thing I wondered was if I could add a 3-line `terragrunt.hcl` under `prod/us-east-1` that would only define `inputs.aws_region`, but given the fact `find_in_parent_folders()` gets the very first file it finds, that would never work...

From my point of view, the current way to duplicate a region would just to duplicate the first level `prod` folder all the way down to every module, but nevertheless I do think having multiple `aws_region` variables under different `prod/some-region` folders don't solve the whole problem either...

I guess the question per se is how to go about a multi-region deployment. Since I fail to see a good enough solution, how does Terragrunt solves it? :)

To do multi region, you duplicate the folder structure from `prod/<region>` on down. The settings and even services in each region are often a bit different, so this is fairly unavoidable.

What settings and services are different?

The answer is to stop using terragrunt. Terragrunt doesn't solve the multi-region problem. It just duplicates ALL the terragrunt code. Which is a terrible solution.
