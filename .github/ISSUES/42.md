# Must repeat local blocks in terragrunt.hcl

**jmcgeheeiv** commented *Aug 5, 2020*

Thank you for Terragrunt. It is a fine tool.

It seems to me that `local` variable definitions are not so DRY. For example, in the sample presented here, the reading of `env.hcl` and the extraction of variable `env` is repeated in `prod/us-east-1/prod/mysql/terragrunt.hcl` and `non-prod/us-east-1/qa/webserver-cluster/terragrunt.hcl`:
```hcl
locals {
  # Automatically load environment-level variables
  environment_vars = read_terragrunt_config(find_in_parent_folders("env.hcl"))

  # Extract out common variables for reuse
  env = local.environment_vars.locals.environment
}
```

Is there no way to put this in the root `terragrunt.hcl` so that all configurations can reference a single definition of `local.env`?

Unfortunately we don't yet have a feature to do this. We have a design for something that makes this possible (see https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/master/_docs/rfc/imports.md), but we haven't implemented it yet.

The well-written RFC you cite shows Gruntworks are obviously well aware of the situation. Therefore I will close this issue in deference to the RFC.
