# [QUESTION] Why we need duplicate read_terragrunt_config block in childs?

**luvs** commented *Jun 8, 2020*

In example in root terragrunt.hcl we have block

```
locals {
  # Automatically load account-level variables
  account_vars = read_terragrunt_config(find_in_parent_folders("account.hcl"))

  # Automatically load region-level variables
  region_vars = read_terragrunt_config(find_in_parent_folders("region.hcl"))

  # Automatically load environment-level variables
  environment_vars = read_terragrunt_config(find_in_parent_folders("env.hcl"))

  # Extract the variables we need for easy access
  account_name = local.account_vars.locals.account_name
  account_id   = local.account_vars.locals.aws_account_id
  aws_region   = local.region_vars.locals.aws_region
}
....
inputs = merge(
  local.account_vars.locals,
  local.region_vars.locals,
  local.environment_vars.locals,
)
```

and in child `non-prod/us-east-1/qa/mysql/terragrunt.hcl` we have also

```
locals {
  # Automatically load environment-level variables
  environment_vars = read_terragrunt_config(find_in_parent_folders("env.hcl"))

  # Extract out common variables for reuse
  env = local.environment_vars.locals.environment
}
```

Why we need duplicate read_terragrunt_config block for `env.hcl`? I think that `inputs = merge` configure root level variables that all resources can inherit?

@luvs I guess we still need to use local to fetch values that are needed to pass inputs:
```hcl
inputs = {
  name           = "mysql_${local.env}"
....
....
....
}
```

Yup, exactly what @ahmad-hamade wrote ^

Per the Terragrunt documentation,

> Currently you can only reference locals defined in the same config file.

Variable `environment_vars` is referenced in both `locals` blocks, so it must be defined in both.

would `generate` locals.tf  in root terragrunt.hcl could mitigate this?
