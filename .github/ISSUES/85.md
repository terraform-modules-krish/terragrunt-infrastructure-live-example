**Describe the solution you'd like**
I would like to have the possibility to reference two modules in `_envcommon` folder through dependenc[y|ies] block. 

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
I have considered having such dependencies on terraform module level however, this takes away the possibility to use standardized modules

**Additional context**
When I try to add a dependency to _envcommon like:
_envcommon/dependencies/vpc/terragrunt.hcl
And in my _envcommon/alb.hcl I state a depenency like: 
```
dependency "vpc" {
  config_path = "${dirname(find_in_parent_folders())}/dependencies/vpc/"
}
```
It resolves to: `/work/_envcommon/dependencies/vpc/terragrunt.hcl` but fails to load `env.hcl`:
`Call to function "find_in_parent_folders" failed: ParentFileNotFound: Could not find a env.hcl in any of the parent folders of /work/_envcommon/dependencies/vpc/terragrunt.hcl`

Not sure if it's the same use case but here is how I reference my dependency:
```
dependency "vpc" {
  config_path = "${get_terragrunt_dir()}/../vpc"
}
```

I've actually figured it out on my own. 
It is sufficient to just place in  my `_envcommon/alb.hcl` following

```hcl
dependency "vpc" {
  config_path = "../vpc"
}
```

Then just use the outputs of the dependency like: 
```hcl
inputs {
  vpc_id = dependency.vpc.outputs.vpc_id
}
```

Can we add it to a documentation README?
