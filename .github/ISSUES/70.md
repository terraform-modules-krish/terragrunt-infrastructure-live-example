# How to access global variables from application/service layer

**archenroot** commented *Nov 2, 2021*

In main terragrunt.hcl file are merged following:
```
# Configure root level variables that all resources can inherit. This is especially helpful with multi-account configs
# where terraform_remote_state data sources are placed directly into the modules.
inputs = merge(
  local.account_vars.locals,
  local.region_vars.locals,
  local.environment_vars.locals,
)
```

But in the example they are never accessed, how to access them from subdirs?

I have found another way to do it via imports, but that is traversing the other way trough a tree:

No, it works via inputs, while in this directory the region and account hcl files defines locals instead of inputs, so it won't work..hm..

Checkout https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/features/keep-your-terragrunt-architecture-dry/, in particular [the section on exposed includes](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/features/keep-your-terragrunt-architecture-dry/#using-exposed-includes-to-override-common-configurations). I believe that is what you are looking for.
