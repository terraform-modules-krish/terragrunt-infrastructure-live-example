# Unused bucket and region variables in account.tfvars

**hammadzz** commented *Jan 20, 2018*

account.tfvars
```
# Root level variables that all modules can inherit. This is especially helpful with multi-account configs
# where terraform_remote_state data sources are placed directly into the modules.

tfstate_global_bucket        = "terragrunt-state-global-non-prod"
tfstate_global_bucket_region = "us-east-1"
aws_profile                  = "non-prod"
```

Were `tfstate_global_bucket` and `tfstate_global_bucket_region` to be used in terraform.tfvars

The file is pulled in by every module: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt-infrastructure-live-example/blob/master/non-prod/terraform.tfvars#L20. It's an example of how to set common variables that are used by all modules. That said, I'm not sure any of the example code in the infra-modules example repo is using those particular variables, so we should probably update the examples accordingly :)

Thanks. I was just confused by why it was there. It didn't make sense that these two variables would even be globally needed.

This example should include environment level variables. For example if you want to tag everything in QA with the environment name and everything in STAGE with the environment name. 

I was thinking of making an envname.tfvar in each environment folder and figuring out the imports such that it imports all the account.tfvars like in this examples and lets you override/add to them. Then this envname.tfvar is imported in each resource file.

Here is how I have done it, as include on a file with an include doesn't work.
**directory structure**
```
└── non-prod
    ├── account.tfvars
    ├── terraform.tfvars
    └── us-east-1
        └── stage
            ├── env.tfvars
            └── postgresql
                └── terraform.tfvars
```

config in non-prod/us-east-1/stage/postgresql/terraform.tfvars
```
terragrunt = {
  # Terragrunt will copy the Terraform configurations specified by the source parameter, along with any files in the
  # working directory, into a temporary folder, and execute your Terraform commands in that folder.
  terraform {
    source = "git::git@github.com:gruntwork-io/terragrunt-infrastructure-modules-example.git//postgresql?ref=v0.0.1"

    required_var_files = [
      "${get_parent_tfvars_dir()}/env.tfvars"
    ]
  }

  # Include all settings from the root terraform.tfvars file
  include = {
    path = "${find_in_parent_folders()}"
  }
}
```

non-prod/us-east-1/stage/env.tfvars
```
environment = "stage"
```

A correction, the above doesn't work. This is quite miserable to learn and get right. I wish it was more like ansible. How do I debug required_var_files or path?

I agree.  I would really like to see an example where I use something defined in account.tfvars in some of the child terraform.tfvars.  I can't find an example anywhere....

@hammadzz @kelsmj  there is no support for it, but there is a workaround I use:

```
terragrunt = {
  terraform {
    source = "git::git@github.com:gruntwork-io/terragrunt-infrastructure-modules-example.git//postgresql?ref=v0.0.1"
    extra_arguments "common_vars" {
      commands = ["${get_terraform_commands_that_need_vars()}"]

      required_var_files = [
        "${get_tfvars_dir()}/${find_in_parent_folders("env.tfvars", "")}"
      ]
    }
  }

  include = {
    path = "${find_in_parent_folders()}"
  }
}
```
