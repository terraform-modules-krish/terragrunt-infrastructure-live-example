# Using Output From Module A as Input into Module B

**hammadzz** commented *Jan 27, 2018*

I have tried this pattern but seem to encounter an issue trying to use an output from a module as an input for another module in terraform.tfvars.

For example in the db terraform.tfvars, using this:
```
db_subnet_group_name		  = "${module.vpc.db_subnet_group_name}"
```

throws the error:
`Underlying error: Invalid interpolation syntax. Expected syntax of the form '${function_name()}', but got '${module.vpc.db_subnet_group_name}'`
<br />

You don't put that code in `terraform.tfvars`. That file is just for setting plain values for Terraform values. If you want to reference another module, you put that code in your `.tf` files.

Hi @brikis98 

Sorry - does it mean that managing environments with `terragrunt.hcl` as described in https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt#keep-your-terraform-code-dry does not allow passing outputs of one module as inputs to another?

I mean, `terragrunt.hcl` doesn't support variables, only plain values... what would be the idiomatic way to allow modules exchange data with `terragrunt`?

Thanks

Unfortunately, currently `terragrunt` does not have a way to read in outputs from other modules into the `inputs` in the `terragrunt.hcl` file.

An alternative way to handle message passing between modules is to use [the `terraform_remote_state` data source](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/terraform/d/remote_state.html). If you are using this example, you should be able to infer the state file path in the bucket because it matches the file path of your live folder. For example, the path to the `mysql` state file in the `prod` environment is `us-east-1/prod/mysql/terraform.tfstate`.

In our environment, we use a global varfile (automatically included by `terragrunt`) that sets the bucket and region of the remote state as variables, that is then used in the submodules to setup the `terraform_remote_state` data source. The key is then inferred based on environment and region of the module call.

Yes, thanks, I've finished up with the approach described here:
https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/303#issuecomment-510309532

In short: you define root variables in parent `terragrunt.hcl` and folder-specific in its own `terragrunt.hcl`. Intermediary vars (e.g. region-wide or env-wide) are stored in YAML and included as suggested above.

If a folder configuration doesn't require outputs from another modules, I include it with `terraform {}` block in `terragrunt.hcl` right away. Otherwise, I use `terragrunt.hcl` together with `main.tf`.

Thank everybody.

The only downside of the approach above though is that I have to declare all variables used by modules in `main.tf`.

Consider the following structure:
```
.
├── dev
│   ├── eks
│   │   ├── main.tf
│   │   └── terragrunt.hcl
│   ├── rds
│   │   └── terragrunt.hcl
│   ├── vars.yaml
│   └── vpc
│       └── terragrunt.hcl
├── prod
│   └── terragrunt.hcl
└── terragrunt.hcl
```
Consider `dev/eks` for example. As this configuration depends on `dev/vpc` outputs, I cannot use `terragrunt.hcl` all alone (the support for `get_output()` would fix that by the way). So I have to have `main.tf` which reads from remote state and use our internal module. 

The thing is that I have to declare variables in `dev/eks/main.tf` like this:
```
terraform {
  backend "s3" {}
}

variable "cluster_name" {}
variable "aws_region" {}
variable "kubernetes_version" {}
variable "instance_type" {}
variable "remote_state_bucket" {}

data "terraform_remote_state" "vpc" {
  backend = "s3"
  config = {
    bucket = var.remote_state_bucket
    key    = "dev/vpc/terraform.tfstate"
    region = var.aws_region
  }
}

module "eks_cluster" {
  source              = "/Users/user/r/tf-modules//eks_cluster"
  cluster_name        = var.cluster_name
  aws_region          = var.aws_region
  kubernetes_version  = var.kubernetes_version
  instance_type       = var.instance_type
  vpc_id              = data.terraform_remote_state.vpc.outputs.vpc_id
  vpc_private_subnets = data.terraform_remote_state.vpc.outputs.private_subnets
}
```

It'd be really appreciated if someone can suggest another more clear way to pass variables.
Thanks.

If I don't declare variables, I get multiple errors:
```
Error: Reference to undeclared input variable

  on main.tf line 25, in module "eks_cluster":
  25:   instance_type       = var.instance_type
```

Well, it seems I've found a better workaround. I've finally managed to define all configurations with a single `terragrunt.hcl` file in each while using each other module's outputs.

Here's how `terragrunt.hcl` of the dependant configuration looks like:
```
include {
  path = find_in_parent_folders()
}

terraform {
  source = "${get_parent_terragrunt_dir()}/../tf-modules//eks_cluster"
}

inputs = merge(
  yamldecode(file("${get_terragrunt_dir()}/${find_in_parent_folders("vars.yaml")}")),
  {
    kubernetes_version  = "1.13",
    instance_type       = "t3.small",
    vpc_id              = trimspace(run_cmd("terragrunt", "output", "vpc_id", "--terragrunt-working-dir", "../vpc"))
    vpc_private_subnets = run_cmd("terragrunt", "output", "private_subnets", "--terragrunt-working-dir", "../vpc")
  }
)

dependencies {
  paths = ["../vpc"]
}
```

@gevial Those are some very creative workarounds!

Do you think it would make sense to add dedicated helpers for some of that? E.g., For reading input variables from an external file (e.g., a `get_input` helper)? Or running `terragrunt output` to get an output from another module (e.g., a `get_output` helper)? The latter in particular could also allow Terragrunt to track dependencies much better between modules.

If those sound worth adding, anyone up for a PR? Adding helpers to Terragrunt is much easier these days... You just add a function here: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/master/config/config_helpers.go#L71-L84
***

**gevial** commented *Jul 15, 2019*

Thanks @brikis98 

At this stage I think both helpers would be helpful. However going forward I think the best solution would be to consider a more holistic approach. One of the good examples is Hiera - Puppet's built-in tool to manage hierarchy of configuration parameters from various sources. In Terragrunt world this kind of solution might support registering outputs as possible source as well.

I will try to devote some time to `get_output`. Please let me know what's the best approach to call Terragrunt from within Terragrunt - is it `cli.CreateTerragruntCli()` and then `run()`? Thanks

Could you give an example of what this would look like?

Probably this method: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/master/cli/cli_app.go#L234

Let's say we have a tf-live repo like this https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt-infrastructure-live-example
You define a hierarchy of data lookups in root `terragrunt.hcl` and then when you run Terragrunt in any sub-folder like `prod/us-east-1/prod/mysql` Terragrunt already knows where to query for input variables and the most specific value it finds (another feature is to merge values found on different hierarchy layers).
The idea is explained here: https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/6.6/hiera_intro.html

@brikis98 Looks like I can't call `cli.RunTerragrunt()` from `config/config_helpers.go` as it will introduce a cyclic dependency: config -> cli -> config
Implementing `get_output()` as shell command run feels a bit hacky and rearranging packages is too much of a change for the single helper function in my opinion. What do you think?

I'm curious what that would look like in the Terragrunt world?

Moving `RunTerragrunt` and its downstream dependencies to a new package (e.g., `run`) makes sense. Looking at it now, it never really belonged in `cli` to begin with, and has made the `cli` package quite bloated. Agreed it's a lot of work for a single helper function, but it will likely be a useful change in general.

Looks like this comment thread has gone off topic, although I am a huge fan of Hiera (as in the popular Puppet tool) and can't wait to see it included with Terraform one of these days

Responding to the original question: I use SSM Parameter Store (I exclusively use AWS). The module that creates the infrastructure (e.g. vpc subnets) also creates `aws_ssm_parameter`. Then, when another module needs the `subnet-id`'s, it will do a `data.aws_ssm_parameter` lookup to get it.  I avoid using data lookups from `data.terraform_remote_state` or module `outputs {}`
***

**taylorturner** commented *Sep 9, 2020*

I'm really disappointed Terragrunt doesn't support using one module's output as the input for another module. I'd think this would be a pretty fundamental feature when using Terraform modules.

**yorinasub17** commented *Sep 9, 2020*

Oh it looks like we forgot to close this issue, as this has been supported for a while with `dependency` blocks:
