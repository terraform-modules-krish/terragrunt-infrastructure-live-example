# terragrunt apply asking for variable input

**headyj** commented *Nov 30, 2018*

Hello,

I did a very similiar project (basically copy/pasted this one) but I have a problem when executing terragrunt apply in a specific module implementation (example in non-prod/us-east-1/qa/mysql), terragrunt is asking me for variables input of values that are already defined in current level terraform.tfvars (here for example instance_class, allocated_storage, etc).

When I see the details of the executed terraform command, it seems that in fact the current directory .tfvars file is not taken:

`terraform apply -var-file=/home/[....]/mariadb/../environment.tfvars -var-file=/home/[...]/mariadb/../../global.tfvars`

I think probably there should be a -va-file=terraform.tfvars but I don't know why it's not included.
