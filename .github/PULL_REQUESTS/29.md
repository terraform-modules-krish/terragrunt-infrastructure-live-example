# Update to recent version of terragrunt with all the new features

**yorinasub17** commented *Mar 5, 2020*

This updates the example to take advantage of the new features we've been implementing:

- Move all the root terragrunt config to the root level, and use the child var data to configure the remote state bucket.
- Use `hcl` instead of `yaml` for pulling in child data.
- Use generate blocks and generate remote state feature.
- Pull in environment name from `env.hcl` to set names of resources.
