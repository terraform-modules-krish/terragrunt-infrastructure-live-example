Would it be useful to include/document the alternate implementation that uses `iam_role` within terragrunt.hcl?

That could look something like:

```hcl
terragrunt.hcl:
----
locals {
  iam_assume_role_for_this_terraform_stack = "arn:aws:iam::...:role/role_name"
  aws_account_id = "a fixed value" # can't use get_aws_account_id()
  
  # If the aws account ID for the current credentials
  # do not match the expected account_id,
  # switch to using an assumed role.
  maybe_iam_role = (get_aws_account_id() != local.aws_account_id) ? local.iam_assume_role_for_this_terraform_root : ""
}

# changing the value of iam_role potentially alters subsequent
# return values from get_aws_account_id():
iam_role = local.maybe_iam_role
```
