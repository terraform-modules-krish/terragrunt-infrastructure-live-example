Good point about the README text contradicting the module constraint! My understanding is that infra-modules pin to exact version on purpose (which seems to be what the [comments there](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt-infrastructure-modules-example/pull/31/files#diff-65ef8ac6702705838d9e3eba09799bbbb817921e1bdcf140e0ec70d806ac5b9dL12) say as well). So I think I should instead fix this README to mention the exact version is needed.
