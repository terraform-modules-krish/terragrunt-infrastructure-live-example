# use list syntax for commands

**jalehman** commented *Nov 16, 2017*

When attempting to run `terragrunt plan`, I got the following error:

```At 19:36: expected: IDENT | STRING | ASSIGN | LBRACE got: COMMA```

Traced it back to a lack of square brackets around the value of `commands`.

*Aside:* Thanks for putting this together!
