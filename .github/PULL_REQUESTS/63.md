# Add Terraform validate test

**zackproser** commented *Jun 17, 2021*

Add Terraform validation test. This test will scan the entire repo for Terraform modules and run terraform init and terraform validate on each.

This example repo contains Terragrunt, not Terraform modules, so this PR is not really applicable.

@zackproser Should we have a `TerragruntValidateAll` too? Doesn't have to be part of same PR / Jira card, but seems just as valuable...
